Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Yes, I'd like to have flexibility. If then project is too huge, and therefore time short, then let's rely on GIT, eventually conflicts 
will be resolved manually

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork clones a repository in github to my profile
clone actually clones a repository from github to local (or from local to local)
branches is a parallel series of commit
